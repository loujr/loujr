### Hi There 👋 I'm Lou! I Build Tech Stuff and Write About It. ☠️

Welcome to my GitHub Profile. I am a Support Engineer for GitHub.


#### README for loujr

💻 I used to be a Systems Administrator. I was in the Webhosting space and did lots of development work on LAMP Stacks. I spent a lot of time monitoring networks for issues and solving problems. During my tenure at the company, we always made our SLA targets. 

📝 I have a passion for technology and my goal is to teach people how to become better in the Tech space. The Tech community is constantly growing and needs a lot of talented individuals to help solve major problems. I struggled a lot when I first started in Tech because I lacked good documentation. Writing is a way for me to solve the problems I faced while trying to develop my skills. 

🌱 I am currently working with and learning the following platforms:

- Ansible
- Docker
- OpenStack
- Python
- Yaml
