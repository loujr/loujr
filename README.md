### Hi There 👋 I'm Lou! I Build Tech Stuff and Write About It. ☠️

Welcome to my GitHub Profile. I am a Technical Editor for the Customer Marketing team at GitHub. This means I work with our customers and find out how they use GitHub so that we can better understand and adapt our platform to better suit their needs. As a Hubber, I work with some pretty amazing people.


#### README for loujr

💻 I used to be a Systems Administrator before I became a Technical Editor. I was in the Webhosting space and did lots of development work on LAMP Stacks. I spent a lot of time monitoring networks for issues and solving problems. During my tenure at the company, we always made our SLA targets. 

📝 I have a passion for technology and my goal is to teach people how to become better in the Tech space. The Tech community is constantly growing and needs a lot of talented individuals to help solve major problems. I struggled a lot when I first started in Tech because I lacked good documentation. Writing is a way for me to solve the problems I faced while trying to develop my skills. 

🌱 I am currently working with and learning the following platforms:

- Ansible
- Docker
- OpenStack
- Python
- Yaml


#### Within GitHub

I am currently contributing to our customer stories: You can find our more about it [here](github.com/customer-stories). Currently, my team and I are exploring three of GitHubs most unique products: 

- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/actions)

- [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.blog/2021-03-30-github-advanced-security-security-overview-beta-secret-scanning-private-repos/)

- [Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)

I help my department gather a greater understanding of the nuances that developers face when they approach various problems using GitHub's tools. Right now, GitHub has a lot of amazing tools that handle things such as: Security, Automation, and CI/CD. And a lot more!

We have a lot of talented engineers that are constantly redefining the DevOps landscape. I am happy to act as a go-between to explain some of these intricacies to less technical users.
