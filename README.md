### Hi There üëã I'm Lou! I Build Tech Stuff and Write About It. ‚ò†Ô∏è

Welcome to my GitHub Profile. I am a Technical Editor for the Customer Marketing team at GitHub. This means I work with our customers and find out how they use GitHub so that we can better understand and adapt our platform to better suit their needs. As a Hubber, I work with some pretty amazing people.

#### README for loujr

üíª I used to be a Systems Administrator before I became a Technical Editor. I was in the Webhosting space and did lots of development work on LAMP Stacks. I spent a lot of time monitoring networks for issues and solving problems. During my tenure at the company, we always made our SLA targets. 

üìù I have a passion for technology and my goal is to teach people how to become better in the Tech space. The Tech community is constantly growing and needs a lot of talented individuals to help solve major problems. I struggled a lot when I first started in Tech because I lacked good documentation. Writing is a way for me to solve the problems I faced while trying to develop my skills. 

üå± I am currently working with and learning the following platforms:

- Ansible
- Docker
- OpenStack
- Python
- Yaml

#### Within GitHub

I help my department gather a greater understanding of the nuances that developers face when they approach various problems using GitHub's tools. Right now, GitHub has a lot of amazing tools that handle things such as: 

- Security
- Automation
- CI/CD

And a lot more!

We have a lot of talented engineers that are constantly redefining the DevOps landscape. I am happy to act as a go-between to explain some of these intricacies to less technical users. 

#### When I am NOT Working

Admittedly, I work a lot at my job. I really enjoy the team I have and I spend a lot of additional time training and exploring new repositories and software and understanding how things work. Technology is my passion. However, I do have other hobbies!

- martial arts 
- music
- If the Internet can be a hobby I like that too
- journaling
- reading
- hiking
