### README for loujr

I used to be a Systems Administrator üíª. I was in the Webhosting space and did lots of development work on LAMP Stacks. I spent a lot of time monitoring networks for issues and solving problems. During my tenure at the company, we always made our SLA targets :dart:. 

I have a passion for technology and my goal is to teach people how to become better in the Tech space :atom: . The Tech community is constantly growing and needs a lot of talented individuals to help solve major problems. I struggled a lot when I first started in Tech because I lacked good documentation :books:. Writing is a way for me to solve the problems I faced while trying to develop my skills. 

I am Co-Founder of a volunteer organization to help teach people on how to contribute to opensource projects. This is designed to help people who have never contributed to a project learn how to use CICD tools :toolbox: - even if your knowledge is not far beyond "Hello World" come visit us at [PaperStreet](https://github.com/paperstreetco).

This is a brief list of some of the platforms I work with consistently:

- Ansible
- Apache
- Docker
- Flask
- GraphQL
- Gunicorn
- MySQL/MariaDB
- Nginx
- OpenStack
- Python
- REST API
- Web Applications
- YAML
